00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,788
<i>lt is written</i>
<i>in the Buddhist Canon...</i>

2
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,762
<i>The flag is still.</i>
<i>The wind is calm.</i>

3
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,767
<i>lt is the heart of man</i>
<i>that is in turmoil.</i>

4
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,998
ASHES OF TIME REDUX

5
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,633
<i>lt is the year of a total eclipse.</i>
<i>Drought sweeps the land.</i>

6
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,843
<i>Drought means problems.</i>

7
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,512
<i>Problems mean good business.</i>

8
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,942
<i>l'm from White Camel Mountain.</i>

9
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,983
<i>My name is Ouyang Feng.</i>

10
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>l specialize in solving problems.</i>

11
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,319
By the Iooks of you,
I'd say you're about forty.

12
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,388
In those forty years...

13
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,529
there must be peopIe you wish
you had never Iaid eyes on.

14
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,691
Maybe they hurt you.

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,795
Maybe you even considered...

16
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,600
kiIIing them.

17
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,375
But you didn't have the ne<i>rv</i>e...

18
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,673
or couIdn't be bothered.

19
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,418
ActuaIIy kiIIing
is no big deaI.

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,757
Now I have a friend
who knows some martiaI arts.

21
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,094
He's a IittIe down on
his Iuck these days.

22
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:51,360
For a smaII fee, he'II be happy
to rid you of that person.

23
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,536
Think about it.

24
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,645
<i>Actually, killing isn't easy.</i>

25
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:04,513
<i>But to survive, it's</i>
<i>a risk many are willing to take.</i>

26
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,914
<i>After leaving White Camel Mountain...</i>

27
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,613
<i>l travelled to this desert...</i>

28
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,188
<i>to start a new life.</i>

29
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,628
JINGZHE
SPRING AWAKENS

30
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,327
<i>lt's the 6th day of the 2nd lunar month.</i>
<i>The insects are awakening.</i>

31
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,734
<i>Every year around this time,</i>
<i>a friend comes to visit.</i>

32
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,840
<i>His name is Huang Yaoshi.</i>

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,808
<i>He's a strange man.</i>

34
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,073
<i>He always appears from the East.</i>

35
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,580
<i>lt's a routine he's kept up for years.</i>

36
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,611
<i>This time he came to deliver a gift.</i>

37
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,950
Someone I met recentIy...

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,221
gave me this bottIe of wine.

39
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,823
She said this wine is magic.

40
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,768
One cup and you'II forget your past.

41
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,506
I thought it was nonsense.

42
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,246
How couId such a wine exist?

43
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,748
She said the root of Man's probIems...

44
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,611
is memory.

45
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,849
Without a past...

46
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,656
every day wouId be a new beginning.

47
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,961
WouIdn't that be great?

48
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,603
The bottIe was meant for you.

49
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,241
But you wouIdn't mind sharing it...

50
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,573
wouId you?

51
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,880
<i>l don't fall</i>
<i>for this kind of nonsense.</i>

52
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,115
<i>So l didn't have a sip.</i>

53
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,355
<i>But it seemed to work.</i>

54
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,558
<i>That night, Huang began</i>
<i>to lose his memory.</i>

55
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,062
Do you remember how we met?

56
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,078
I don't quite recaII.

57
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,341
Then how did you get here?

58
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,375
I don't remember.

59
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,017
Why are you staring at the bird cage?

60
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,117
Because it Iooks famiIiar.

61
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,950
<i>He got very drunk that night.</i>

62
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,854
<i>He rode off at dawn.</i>

63
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,217
<i>l don't know what</i>
<i>was troubling him...</i>

64
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,993
<i>but it probably</i>
<i>had to do with a woman.</i>

65
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,533
<i>A month later, Huang Yaoshi</i>
<i>turned up in the South...</i>

66
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,277
<i>in the hometown</i>
<i>of his best friend.</i>

67
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,572
<i>He visited once before</i>
<i>for his friend's wedding.</i>

68
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,583
<i>He spent time with the couple.</i>

69
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,087
<i>One day, his friend</i>
<i>left town suddenly.</i>

70
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:09,052
<i>Then Huang left too,</i>
<i>and never returned.</i>

71
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,752
May I offer you a drink?

72
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,945
Just water for me.

73
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,571
We know each other, don't we?

74
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,217
More than that.

75
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,744
You were once my best friend.

76
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,051
But not anymore.

77
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,197
Why are you here?

78
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,534
I met someone recentIy...

79
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,639
who gave me this bottIe of wine.

80
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,136
One cup and you'II
forget your past.

81
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,639
I tried it.

82
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,705
It works.

83
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,680
WouId you Iike a taste?

84
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,754
Do you know the difference
between water and wine?

85
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,453
Wine warms the spirit.

86
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,794
Water onIy brings on a chiII.

87
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,569
WiII I ever see you here again?

88
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:48,680
No.

89
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,815
<i>l once took an oath.</i>

90
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,281
<i>lf l ever saw this man again,</i>
<i>l'd kill him.</i>

91
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,187
<i>But l didn't follow through.</i>

92
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,590
<i>Because by the time we met again,</i>
<i>l could no longer see.</i>

93
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,892
So what are you, man or woman?

94
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,666
I am the princess...

95
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,537
of the great Murong CIan.

96
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,573
You dare insuIt me thus?

97
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,010
Don't you know I'II kiII you?

98
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,018
You're drunk.

99
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,598
<i>Huang Yaoshi was once wild and free.</i>

100
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:28,712
<i>People fell for him,</i>
<i>and often got hurt.</i>

101
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,349
<i>That night,</i>
<i>Huang was nearly killed.</i>

102
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,461
<i>Every year there are months when</i>
<i>no one seems to need my services.</i>

103
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,505
<i>Last year, business</i>
<i>was slow when spring came.</i>

104
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,040
<i>For a month,</i>
<i>l had only one customer.</i>

105
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,608
I want you to kiII someone.

106
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,138
His name is Huang Yaoshi.

107
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,940
He's one of
the best swordsmen around.

108
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,775
It won't be an easy job.

109
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,586
Money is no object.

110
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,553
There's onIy one condition.

111
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,618
I decide how he dies.

112
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,391
I want his death
to be as painfuI as possibIe.

113
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,227
What did he do to dese<i>rv</i>e this?

114
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,472
He Ieft my sister...

115
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,166
for another woman.

116
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,711
<i>He called himself Murong Yang,</i>
<i>the only son of the Murong Clan.</i>

117
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,553
<i>He had met Huang Yaoshi at the Peach</i>
<i>Blossom Grove outside Gusu City.</i>

118
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,886
<i>lt was the 4th day of the 1st lunar</i>
<i>month. The first day of spring.</i>

119
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,486
<i>The almanac read...</i>

120
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,391
<i>''The East wind warms.''</i>

121
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,088
<i>lt's a day for new beginnings.</i>

122
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,763
<i>That night,</i>
<i>Huang played a joke on him.</i>

123
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,767
If you have a sister...

124
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,473
I'II marry her.

125
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:53,817
Fine.

126
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,484
I'II hoId you to your word.

127
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,063
Yet I warn you,
do not break your word.

128
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,759
For if you do...

129
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,701
I wiII kiII you.

130
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,176
<i>They arranged to meet his sister.</i>

131
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,472
<i>But Huang Yaoshi never showed.</i>

132
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,469
Did my brother come to see you?

133
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,206
Who's your brother?

134
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,504
His name is Murong Yang.

135
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,571
The name rings a beII.

136
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,474
Did he ask you to kiII a man?

137
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,484
I forget.

138
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,218
Mark my words!

139
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,624
I'II kiII you
if you accept his offer.

140
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,860
Your brother is a generous man.

141
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,624
I can't afford to turn him down.

142
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,004
Big spenders Iike him
are scarce these days.

143
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,504
If you reject him...,

144
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,742
I'II pay you doubIe
to cover your Ioss.

145
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,877
But I do have one condition.

146
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,984
You must kiII someone for me...

147
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,883
my brother, Murong Yang!

148
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,191
You two have an odd reIationship.

149
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,752
You sure you hate
your brother that much?

150
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,960
Yes!

151
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,691
He won't Iet me be with Huang Yaoshi.

152
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,269
He thinks I beIong to him.

153
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,699
Therefore he must die.

154
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,051
Has my sister caIIed upon you?

155
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:36,449
Yes.

156
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,621
If you so much as covet her...

157
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,989
I'II kiII you.

158
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,317
What a caring brother.

159
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,624
She's the onIy famiIy I have.
I must protect her.

160
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,965
-What did she want from you?
-To kiII someone for her.

161
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,196
Someone caIIed Murong Yang.

162
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,512
Huang Yaoshi must be behind this.

163
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,880
With or without him,
she'd do the same.

164
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,812
She wants to be free of you.

165
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,046
I'II never aIIow that,
as Iong as I Iive.

166
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,677
You saw my brother today,
didn't you?

167
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,542
He toId you?

168
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,718
Why didn't you kiII him?

169
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,589
Who wiII pay me if I do?

170
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,062
KiIIing your brother is no sweat,
because he has a weakness.

171
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,497
You know what that is?
It's you.

172
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:08,439
I toId him you wanted him dead
just to see his reaction.

173
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,907
Ever think he doesn't want you
to be with Huang...

174
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,186
because he wants you for himseIf?

175
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,824
If that's the case,
how strongIy does he want you?

176
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,186
He wants us to be together forever.

177
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,797
Then he must want you very much.

178
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,230
I know.

179
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,664
But I don't want him.

180
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,698
I onIy have feeIings for Huang.

181
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,704
He must be heartbroken.

182
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,139
So what?

183
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,077
My sadness is unbearabIe.

184
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,780
Why shouId I be aIone in my misery?

185
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,776
I want him to know what it's Iike
to be rejected by the one you Iove.

186
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,747
You're a crueI woman.

187
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,221
-And if he kiIIs himseIf?
-That se<i>rv</i>es him right!

188
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,489
Why are you asking me aII this?

189
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,998
Your brother asked me a question.

190
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,763
It took me a Iong time
to figure out the answer.

191
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,136
The most painfuI way
to kiII a person...

192
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,970
is first to kiII
the person he Ioves most.

193
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,936
But I can't do that.

194
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,714
If I kiII you,
how wouId I get paid?

195
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,017
Right?

196
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,178
Someone's trying to kiII me.

197
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,489
Why?

198
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,856
They say I'm the woman
Huang Yaoshi Ioves most.

199
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,468
Don't Iet them kiII me.

200
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,271
<i>That evening, she refused to leave.</i>

201
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,603
<i>l gave her some wine</i>
<i>to calm her down.</i>

202
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,648
<i>A few drinks later,</i>
<i>she fell asleep.</i>

203
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,549
Where are you hiding my sister?

204
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,714
What makes you think that?

205
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:39,056
I know you're the Iast person
she saw before she disappeared.

206
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,164
She did show up one night.

207
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,836
She said her Iife was
in danger and needed to hide.

208
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,036
But she Ieft afterwards.

209
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,740
Didn't she go home?

210
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,507
My sister has offended no one.

211
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,512
Why wouId anyone want to kiII her?

212
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,846
She said it's because she's
the woman Huang Yaoshi Ioves most.

213
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,117
Nonsense.

214
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,855
If Huang Ioves her,
why did he Ieave her?

215
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,593
Some peopIe don't reaIize
who they Iove...

216
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,462
untiI they've Ieft
that person behind.

217
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,465
Maybe Huang's Iike that.

218
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,608
He's not.

219
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,335
What makes you so sure?

220
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,019
Because he's in Iove
with another woman.

221
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,890
<i>People always find ways</i>
<i>to mask their pain.</i>

222
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:49,097
<i>Actually, Murong Yin and Murong Yang</i>
<i>were just two sides of one person.</i>

223
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,731
<i>Hiding behind these two identities</i>
<i>was a wounded soul.</i>

224
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,073
You're drunk, Mr. Murong.

225
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:57,742
Mister?

226
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:02,780
You are mistaken.

227
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,881
I'm not Mr. Murong...

228
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:12,488
but the princess
of the great Murong CIan.

229
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,552
My name is Murong Yin.

230
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,530
And who might you be?

231
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,632
You don't remember me?

232
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,504
You once promised to marry me.

233
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,343
How couId I forget you?

234
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,780
That's so?

235
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,814
That day you passed
through Gusu City.

236
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,060
We drank together
in the Peach BIossom Grove.

237
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,887
You were drunk.
You touched my face.

238
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,825
And you said
if I had a sister...

239
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,400
you'd marry her.

240
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,865
You knew I was a woman in disguise.

241
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,111
Why did you say that?

242
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:14,616
<i>A drunk man's words</i>
<i>can't be taken seriously.</i>

243
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:21,786
Those words have kept me waiting
for you aII this time.

244
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:27,922
I asked you to take me with you,
but you refused.

245
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,895
You said your heart did
not have room for two.

246
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,803
SureIy you Ioved Murong Yin.

247
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,638
How couId you faII in Iove
with another woman?

248
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,279
You know I went Iooking
for that other woman?

249
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,350
When I heard rumor
she was the one you Ioved most...

250
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,593
I went to kiII her.

251
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,197
But I couIdn't go through with it...

252
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,962
because that wouId onIy prove
the rumor correct.

253
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,776
I've asked myseIf so many times...

254
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,712
am I reaIIy
the woman you Iove most?

255
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,952
But I no Ionger want to know.

256
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,483
If I ever ask you this question,
pIease Iie.

257
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,989
No matter how your heart rebeIs...

258
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,726
pIease teII me I'm
the one you Iove the most.

259
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,506
<i>That night passed slowly.</i>

260
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,911
<i>Probably because l seemed to be</i>
<i>talking to 2 people at the same time.</i>

261
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:58,813
<i>l could no longer distinguish</i>
<i>Murong Yin from Murong Yang.</i>

262
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,434
Murong Yin?

263
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,161
Murong Yang?

264
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,072
TeII me,
who do you Iove the most?

265
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,151
Who eIse but you?

266
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,952
<i>Once, a woman asked me this question.</i>
<i>But l didn't answer.</i>

267
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,692
<i>Speaking as Huang Yaoshi...</i>

268
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,221
<i>l realized it wasn't so hard</i>
<i>to say those words.</i>

269
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,714
<i>As l lay sleeping that night,</i>
<i>l felt someone touch me.</i>

270
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,602
<i>l knew l wasn't the man</i>
<i>she wanted to touch.</i>

271
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,170
<i>But just as she was</i>
<i>imagining l was another man...</i>

272
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,034
<i>l was dreaming of another woman.</i>

273
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,379
<i>Her hands were soft...</i>

274
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,709
<i>like the hands</i>
<i>of my brother's wife.</i>

275
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:47,778
<i>After that night, no one saw</i>
<i>Murong Yin or Murong Yang again.</i>

276
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,854
<i>A few years later, legend spread</i>
<i>of a strange sword master...</i>

277
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,483
<i>with a mysterious past.</i>

278
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,620
<i>lt's said she practiced her</i>
<i>swordplay on her own reflection...</i>

279
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,263
<i>because she could find</i>
<i>no worthier opponent.</i>

280
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,619
XIAZHI
SUMMER RISES

281
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,126
What do you want?

282
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,295
I want to avenge my IittIe brother.

283
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,569
What happened to him?

284
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,635
A band of swordsmen passed
by a few days ago.

285
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:24,744
My brother offended one of them.

286
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,743
They kiIIed him.

287
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,818
ShouIdn't this be a matter
for the IocaI magistrate?

288
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,828
They're in the miIitia.

289
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,731
The magistrate wouIdn't
dare do a thing.

290
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,197
How much can you pay?

291
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,173
We're a poor famiIy.

292
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:56,906
AII I've got are these eggs
and my muIe.

293
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,112
Before she died, my mom gave me
this muIe as my dowry.

294
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,085
To avenge your brother...

295
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,127
you need money.

296
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,659
No one's going to take on
those swordsmen for a muIe.

297
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,966
Vengeance has a price.

298
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,534
If you weren't so pretty...

299
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,237
I wouId've toId you to forget it.

300
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,108
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not hinting at anything.

301
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,081
But you shouId know...

302
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,348
that you're worth
much more than a muIe.

303
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,325
You understand?

304
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,563
I'm not that kind of woman.

305
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,956
If money's aII you want...

306
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,195
I'II wait here...

307
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,832
untiI someone eIse comes to heIp.

308
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,108
<i>I'm not sure if she
was just naïve...</i>

309
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,048
<i>or if she really had</i>
<i>nothing better to offer.</i>

310
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,088
<i>From up here...</i>

311
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,460
<i>she looks a lot like</i>
<i>someone l knew.</i>

312
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,190
<i>During the nights that followed,</i>
<i>l had a recurring dream.</i>

313
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,170
<i>l dreamed of the peach blossoms</i>
<i>in my hometown.</i>

314
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,301
<i>l suddenly realized...</i>

315
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,570
<i>l hadn't been back to White</i>
<i>Camel Mountain for many years.</i>

316
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,643
Something wrong with your eyes?

317
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,376
I've had bad eyesight
since I was smaII.

318
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,786
The doctor said
by thirty I'd be bIind.

319
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,520
How oId are you?

320
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:57,752
AImost thirty.

321
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:01,989
What brings you here?

322
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,899
The peach bIossoms bIoom beautifuIIy
every spring in my hometown.

323
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,573
I want to see them once more
before I go bIind...

324
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,504
but I'm aImost penniIess now.

325
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,143
They say you soIve
probIems for peopIe.

326
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:19,741
Can you heIp me?

327
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:25,522
A friend of mine kiIIed
some bandits a few months back.

328
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,683
Their gang shouId return
to avenge them soon.

329
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,890
My friend's gone.

330
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,798
The viIIagers are starting
a coIIection...

331
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,129
to hire a swordsman for protection.

332
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,909
I've heard of a IocaI swordsman
who's supposed to be fast.

333
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,912
-Is he stiII here?
-Why do you care?

334
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,550
I want to see just how fast he is.

335
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,488
I shouIdn't have come.

336
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,291
It's too Iate now.

337
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,321
Let's Ieave it at an arm.

338
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:05,591
No.

339
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,586
Let's Ieave it at...

340
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,054
your Iife!

341
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,057
You misunderstood.

342
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,618
I shouIdn't have come because
you're not a worthy opponent.

343
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,791
I said Iet's Ieave it at your arm,
but you offered up your Iife.

344
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:54,636
Can you heIp me, sir?

345
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,747
<i>Although he was a down-and-out</i>
<i>swordsman...</i>

346
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,084
<i>he lived a very disciplined life.</i>

347
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:11,553
<i>Everyday he'd come by for</i>
<i>a meal and a drink...</i>

348
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,156
<i>and leave at sunset.</i>

349
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,616
Why do you keep
staring at that girI?

350
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,056
She reminds me of someone.

351
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,899
Your wife?

352
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,598
If you miss her so much,
why Iive Iife on the road?

353
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,646
She's in Iove with my best friend.

354
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,454
When wiII those bandits get here?

355
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,922
ProbabIy within the next few days.

356
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,554
The sooner the better.

357
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,224
I don't want to miss
the peach bIossoms.

358
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,912
<i>Flowers bloom in their season.</i>

359
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,758
<i>But bandits are harder to predict.</i>

360
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,194
<i>He waited outside</i>
<i>the village everyday.</i>

361
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,794
<i>Each day's wait lasted</i>
<i>longer into the night.</i>

362
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,870
<i>Though he lit a lamp after sunset...</i>

363
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,134
<i>l knew</i>
<i>he couldn't see at night.</i>

364
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,542
Don't you Iike me?

365
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,215
You want to go home?

366
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,053
Yes.

367
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:01,423
-Are you married?
-Why?

368
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,632
I bet you Iove your wife very much.

369
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,264
You couId say that.

370
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,734
Then why did you Ieave her?

371
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,658
WouId you mind treating me
to another drink?

372
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,743
You seem to be in a drinking mood.

373
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,046
I might not be abIe
to drink again tomorrow.

374
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,199
My guess is they'II arrive
before dawn.

375
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,531
I'II get you a Iantern.

376
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,636
Don't bother.

377
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,278
You can't see anymore, can you?

378
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,613
I can, if the sun is bright.

379
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,808
Pray tomorrow's a cIear day.

380
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,213
If I don't return by sunset...

381
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,715
pIease take a message
to someone for me.

382
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,659
His name is Huang Yaoshi.

383
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,258
TeII him a woman's waiting
for him in my hometown.

384
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,141
<i>l don't know why l did that.</i>

385
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,744
<i>l couldn't control myself.</i>

386
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:37,979
<i>As l walked away...</i>

387
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,954
<i>l felt the girl's tears</i>
<i>slowly drying on my face.</i>

388
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,663
<i>l wondered if my woman</i>
<i>would shed any tears for me.</i>

389
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,231
<i>People say if a sword</i>
<i>strikes fast enough...</i>

390
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,859
<i>the blood spurting from the wound</i>
<i>will sigh like a breeze.</i>

391
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,363
<i>Never had l imagined the first</i>
<i>time l heard that sound...</i>

392
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,100
<i>it would come from</i>
<i>the spurting of my own blood.</i>

393
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,919
BAILU
AUTUMN TURNS

394
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:55,791
<i>This man is Hong Qi.</i>

395
00:48:56,733 --> 00:49:00,328
<i>He's very quick with his saber,</i>
<i>but he didn't like wearing shoes.</i>

396
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,229
<i>While l knew he could make me</i>
<i>a lot of money...</i>

397
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,001
<i>he always made me uneasy.</i>

398
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,611
<i>A fortune teller once warned me...</i>

399
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,580
<i>''Avoid the number seven</i>
<i>or anyone with the name of Qi.''</i>

400
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,982
<i>When l first met him,</i>
<i>he was fresh from the countryside.</i>

401
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,457
Do you know why
I asked you over to eat?

402
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:23,217
No.

403
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,456
Because I know you're hungry.

404
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:28,858
I've had my eye on
you for a whiIe.

405
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,159
You've been sitting by that
waII aII day, too weak to move.

406
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,499
And you don't Iook sick.

407
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,834
I've seen a Iot
of young men Iike you.

408
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,571
You know a few sword moves,
so you think you're invincibIe.

409
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,050
But this is a tough Iine of work.

410
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,517
Being a swordsman keeps
you from doing a normaI job.

411
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,950
Farming's beneath you.

412
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,514
Banditry is not honorabIe.

413
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,318
Street performing is a joke.

414
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:00,259
So how do you earn a Iiving?

415
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,130
Even the best swordsman has to eat.

416
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,296
I've got the perfect job for you.

417
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:13,133
The money's good and
it's honorabIe. What do you say?

418
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,307
Yes?

419
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,848
Think about it, but be quick.

420
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,214
As you know, your stomach
wiII be growIing again soon.

421
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:39,530
<i>Soon after Hong Qi arrived,</i>
<i>the bandits returned.</i>

422
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,772
<i>Before l took him</i>
<i>to see the villagers...</i>

423
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,006
<i>l bought him a pair of shoes...</i>

424
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,174
<i>because there's quite</i>
<i>a difference...</i>

425
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,043
<i>between the price of a swordsman</i>
<i>with shoes and without.</i>

426
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,814
So you think ten taeIs
of siIver is too much?

427
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,719
You can aIways
find someone cheaper.

428
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,230
Look, there's some now.

429
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,292
They're not even wearing shoes.

430
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,597
Pay them a few bucks
and they'II jump on the offer.

431
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,697
But how can you trust a swordsman...

432
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,804
who can't even afford shoes?

433
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:34,214
What if he takes a beating
and teIIs the bandits you hired him.

434
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:36,985
Then what?

435
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,930
Now, I'm not saying
my friend is the best.

436
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:48,027
What I'm saying is this, when the
Iives of your famiIy are at stake...

437
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:54,635
don't you think, you shouId put
your faith in someone with shoes?

438
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:56,777
<i>To prepare him for the job...</i>

439
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,410
<i>l brought Hong Qi</i>
<i>to see something.</i>

440
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,247
-Why the corpse?
-Because this corpse can taIk.

441
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,746
Two days ago,
he fought the bandits.

442
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,622
He thought he couId take them aII.

443
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,520
He was wrong.

444
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,629
See this sIash?
It was the fataI bIow.

445
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:21,066
UnIike the other wounds,
it cut from right to Ieft.

446
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:23,703
It's unique.

447
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:29,238
That means the guy
who struck the fataI bIow...

448
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,976
onIy needed to strike once.

449
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:35,979
When you fight the bandits...

450
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,146
Iook out for one person...

451
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,281
the Ieft-handed swordsman.

452
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,358
If I die, don't put me on dispIay.

453
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:50,831
I don't want to be a taIking corpse.

454
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,661
<i>The 1 5th day of the 6th lunar month.</i>
<i>lt was sunny and windy.</i>

455
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,142
<i>The almanac says,</i>
<i>''The Star of Judgment descends.''</i>

456
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,534
<i>''Blood will flow.</i>
<i>Do not travel far.''</i>

457
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,842
<i>''Chant scriptures</i>
<i>to prevent catastrophe.''</i>

458
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,602
<i>Those who don't bother</i>
<i>counting their money...</i>

459
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,874
<i>will soon lose it all.</i>

460
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,282
<i>Not Hong Qi.</i>
<i>He counted every cent.</i>

461
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,788
<i>This type of person</i>
<i>won't stay long.</i>

462
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:36,260
<i>The 10th day of the 7th lunar month.</i>
<i>The first day of autumn. Sunny.</i>

463
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,128
<i>The almanac says, ''The breeze cools.</i>
<i>Auspicious for visiting friends.''</i>

464
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,795
<i>''Do not christen new boats.''</i>

465
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:44,936
Hong Qi?

466
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:46,774
He's gone.

467
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,277
I doubt he'II come back.

468
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,615
You shouId Iook eIsewhere.

469
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,762
You hear me?

470
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,469
<i>Fooling a woman is never</i>
<i>as easy as you think.</i>

471
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:24,204
<i>She might seem simple...</i>

472
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,780
<i>but she understood</i>
<i>her husband well.</i>

473
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,680
<i>Because Hong Qi would never</i>
<i>abandon his camel.</i>

474
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,557
I toId you to wait at home.

475
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,625
Why are you foIIowing me?

476
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:48,800
Go home!

477
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,398
Go!

478
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:53,799
No!

479
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,246
Go home! Go!

480
00:56:58,848 --> 00:56:59,815
Go home!

481
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:05,747
Go!

482
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:07,988
Get going! Move!

483
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,509
She's been waiting outside
for days now.

484
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,708
She doesn't Iisten.
What can I do?

485
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,976
How can I be a swordsman
with a wife in town?

486
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:37,610
Who says you can't?

487
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,883
Where there's a wiII,
there's a way.

488
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,520
I was once Iike you.

489
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,597
My head was fiIIed with
thoughts of gIory.

490
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,500
So I Ieft my woman at home.

491
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,741
When I returned, I discovered...

492
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,744
that my woman had married
my brother.

493
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,156
It's pointIess to come
here everyday.

494
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,653
I can't heIp you if
you haven't got any money.

495
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,692
Go home.

496
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:27,767
I'm begging you.

497
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:29,772
Begging won't heIp.

498
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,038
I'm just a middIeman.

499
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,344
The onIy person that can heIp
you is yourseIf.

500
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,891
<i>Everyone needs something</i>
<i>to live for.</i>

501
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:59,191
<i>Others may think it's a waste of</i>
<i>time, but it was important to her.</i>

502
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,740
<i>The 1 5th day of the</i>
<i>7th lunar month. Rain.</i>

503
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,714
<i>According to the almanac,</i>
<i>''The Rain Star brings trouble.''</i>

504
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,547
<i>''The Star of Talent presides.''</i>

505
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,951
<i>''Time to cleanse.</i>
<i>Avoid leaving home.''</i>

506
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,957
<i>''Malignance in the north.''</i>

507
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,161
<i>lf l were those swordsmen</i>
<i>from the militia...</i>

508
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,195
<i>l would have refused to die.</i>

509
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,632
<i>All those lives were lost</i>
<i>merely for an egg.</i>

510
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,841
You gained an egg, but Iost a finger.
Was it worth it?

511
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:58,919
No.

512
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,783
But I feIt aIive.

513
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,718
I was myseIf again.

514
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,625
This shouId have been no sweat.

515
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:18,039
But I've Iost my speed.

516
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,940
I was quick because
I never hesitated.

517
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:25,410
If it feIt right, I'd do it.

518
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,647
I never cared about the money.

519
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:33,483
I thought I'd aIways be that way.

520
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:37,125
Then that girI asked me for heIp...

521
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,789
and I knew I was a changed man.

522
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:45,829
I turned her down...

523
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,299
because I knew you wouId.

524
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:57,807
I hated myseIf for it.

525
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,480
I confused myseIf with you.

526
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,553
I'd Iost my reaI seIf.

527
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,219
I don't want to be Iike you...

528
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:24,729
because I know you'd never ever
risk your Iife for an egg.

529
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,576
That's the difference between us.

530
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:53,797
PIease heIp Hong Qi!

531
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,235
He's hurt bad, isn't he?

532
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:08,443
-PIease get a doctor.
-A doctor? That costs money.

533
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:14,445
Damn shame I don't have any eggs.
Otherwise I'd Iend you a few...

534
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,224
since you're so good
at manipuIating peopIe with them.

535
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,801
I won't heIp him
because he didn't Iisten to me.

536
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,238
You're responsibIe for this.

537
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:40,807
You save him.

538
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:47,750
You come to me onIy
because you're desperate.

539
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,587
I've been waiting for this moment.

540
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:57,192
You once toId me you'd
never seII yourseIf.

541
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:01,198
WeII, Iet's see now
if you can stiII keep your word.

542
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,740
-What's on your mind?
-Nothing.

543
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,784
Don't do anything for my sake.

544
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,956
If I die...

545
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,685
I'II die happy.

546
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:34,102
I heIped you for an egg.

547
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,034
I've eaten it.

548
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:42,642
You don't owe me anything.

549
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,806
Remember,
don't do anything stupid.

550
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:57,117
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>l never saw that girl again.</i>

551
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,610
I don't think I can
use my saber anymore.

552
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,056
You don't need to use a saber.

553
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,584
Even a Iook can kiII.

554
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:36,558
Losing a finger
wiII heIp your reputation.

555
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,790
You can raise your fee.

556
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,194
What's the matter?

557
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,838
Homesick?

558
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:46,797
If you get homesick so easiIy,
why'd you Ieave in the first pIace?

559
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,542
You ever wonder what Iies
beyond this desert?

560
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,740
Another desert.

561
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,982
<i>lt's a question everyone</i>
<i>asks at some point in life.</i>

562
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,449
<i>They see a mountain and want</i>
<i>to know what's behind it.</i>

563
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,355
<i>l wanted to tell him...</i>

564
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,723
<i>the other side may</i>
<i>just be more of the same.</i>

565
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,229
<i>Looking back, home may</i>
<i>not seem so bad after all.</i>

566
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:11,659
<i>But he'd never listen.</i>

567
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,230
<i>He was the kind of person</i>
<i>who'd have to see for himself.</i>

568
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:26,674
Where are you going?

569
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,610
PIaces I've never been.
With Iuck, I'II be famous.

570
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,250
If one day you hear
of a nine-fingered hero...

571
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:33,520
that'II be me.

572
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:34,986
And her?

573
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,524
I'II take her aIong.

574
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:39,857
Like you said, where there's
a wiII, there's a way.

575
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,227
Besides, there's no martiaI arts code
against bringing a wife aIong. Right?

576
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:45,857
Let's go!

577
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,260
<i>l suddenly understood</i>
<i>why they are a couple.</i>

578

<i>Because they both</i>
<i>are true to their hearts.</i>

579
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,403
<i>As l watched them leave,</i>
<i>l was filled with envy.</i>

581
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:05,176
<i>l don't know why</i>
<i>l let it slip away.</i>

582
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,068
<i>The day they left,</i>
<i>a southerly wind was blowing.</i>

583
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,539
<i>They chose to walk into the wind.</i>

584
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,570
<i>lt was the 1 5th day</i>
<i>of the 8th lunar month.</i>

585
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:02,443
<i>The almanac had this to say...</i>

586
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,876
<i>''The Chamber Star presides.</i>
<i>Fortune favors the north.''</i>

587
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:09,683
<i>Hong Qi joined the Gang</i>

588
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,050
<i>He became their leader and was</i>

<i>where they took each other's life.</i>

591
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:27,096
<i>After Hong Qi left,</i>

<i>Every time it rains,</i>

<i>She once loved me.</i>

594
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,711
<i>Maybe it was just coincidence...</i>

595
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:43,283

597

<i>The day of their wedding,</i>
<i>l left White Camel Mountain.</i>

<i>You can ask me today,</i>

600
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,860
<i>My answer will be the same.</i>

LICHUN
WINTER FADES

607
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,375
Why are you staring
at my scarf?

608
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:58,980
It beIongs to my husband.
Why do you have it?

609
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,236
Is he dead?

610
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,141
<i>l hadn't seen peach blossoms</i>

01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:42,919
<i>He's an odd child, isn't he?</i>

620
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:45,654
<i>He keeps to himself.</i>

621
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,123
<i>l'm not sure</i>
<i>if he's arrogant or shy.</i>

622
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:55,335
He never asks for what he wants.
He expects to be pIeased.

623
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,571
You have to offer it to him.

624
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,248
At first, I induIged him.

625
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:11,251
GraduaIIy, I Iost my patience.

626
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:16,185
<i>Though l've always loved her,</i>
<i>l've kept it a secret.</i>

627
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,793
<i>Because l know untasted fruit</i>
<i>is the sweetest.</i>

628
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,588
<i>Every time she gazed fondly</i>
<i>at her son...</i>

629
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,560
<i>l knew she was thinking</i>
<i>of someone else.</i>

630
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,535
<i>l envy Ouyang Feng.</i>

631
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,003
<i>l long to be loved...</i>

632
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,704
<i>yet only manage to hurt others.</i>

633
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,973
I aIways thought you two
wouId stay together.

634
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,910
Why didn't you marry him?

635
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:51,624
He never toId me how much
he wanted me.

636
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,625
Some things don't need to be said.

637
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,431
But it's what I needed to hear.

638
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:01,729
He was too proud to say it.

639
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:08,366
He took it for granted
that I wouId marry him.

640
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:11,840
He never imagined
I'd marry his brother.

641
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:19,986
On my wedding night,
he asked me to Ieave with him.

642
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,316
But I refused.

643
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,186
Why did he want me onIy
when he couIdn't have me?

644
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:31,856
If that's the way
he was going to be...

645
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,765
I decided I wouId never
Iet him have me.

646
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:38,102
<i>lf love is a contest,</i>
<i>l'm not sure she's the winner.</i>

647
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,508
<i>But l know for certain...</i>

648
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,872
<i>l've been a loser from the start.</i>

649
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,878
<i>This woman made me</i>
<i>love peach blossoms.</i>

650
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:55,416
<i>l'd see her each year when</i>
<i>the peach blossoms bloomed.</i>

651
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:58,654
<i>l visited Ouyang Feng...</i>

652
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,688
<i>because she wanted to know</i>
<i>how he was doing.</i>

653
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:04,559
<i>Thanks to Ouyang Feng...</i>

654
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,864
<i>l had an excuse</i>
<i>to see her every year.</i>

655
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:13,474
Do you know what's the most
important thing in my Iife now?

656
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:20,413
Your son, no doubt.

657
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,013
I once thought so.

658
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:29,148
But as I watch him grow day by day...

659
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,627
I know someday he'II Ieave me.

660
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,927
Nothing reaIIy matters anymore.

661
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:49,402
I used to think some words
were so important.

662
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:56,818
Once spoken they'd Iast a Iifetime.

663
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:06,984
But Iooking back, I reaIized
it makes no difference.

664
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,289
Everything changes.

665
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,868
I aIways thought I was the winner...

666
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,709
untiI one day I Iooked
in the mirror...

667
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:34,753
and saw the face of a Ioser.

668
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,184
During the best years of my Iife...

669
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,258
the person I Iove was not by my side.

670
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,975
WouIdn't it be wonderfuI
if we couId go back to the past?

671
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,793
You're his good friend.

672
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,731
Why haven't you toId him I was here?

673
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:01,906
I made you a promise.

674
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,406
So I kept siIent.

675
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:11,711
You're too honest.

676
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:51,543
<i>Not long after, she fell ill</i>
<i>and passed away.</i>

677
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:57,949
<i>Before she died, she gave me</i>
<i>a bottle of wine to take to him.</i>

678
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,456
<i>She hoped Ouyang Feng</i>
<i>would forget her.</i>

679
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:11,869
<i>lt's said memory is</i>
<i>the root of Man's troubles.</i>

680
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,337
<i>That year,</i>
<i>l started to lose my memory.</i>

681
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:23,412
<i>Now, l only recall a vague</i>
<i>fondness for peach blossoms.</i>

682
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:31,055
<i>Six years later, Huang Yaoshi</i>
<i>retired to Peach Blossom lsland...</i>

683
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,861
<i>and lived as a hermit.</i>

684
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,920
<i>He called himself the Master</i>
<i>of Peach Blossom lsland.</i>

685
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,521
<i>Others knew him</i>
<i>as the Lord of the East.</i>

686
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:49,577
JINGZHE
SPRING RETURNS

687
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,906
<i>Spring begins.</i>
<i>The insects will soon awaken.</i>

688
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:57,674
<i>Every year around this time,</i>
<i>a friend comes to visit.</i>

689
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:00,386
<i>But this year he didn't show.</i>

690
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,776
<i>Shortly afterwards, l received</i>
<i>a letter from White Camel Mountain.</i>

691
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:30,517
<i>lt said my brother's wife</i>
<i>had died two winters ago.</i>

692
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:36,586
<i>l knew Huang Yaoshi</i>
<i>wouldn't come again.</i>

693
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:39,358
<i>Yet still l waited.</i>

694
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:43,263
<i>For two days and two nights,</i>
<i>l sat at my door.</i>

695
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:46,232
<i>Watching the shifting clouds,</i>
<i>l realized...</i>

696
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:49,134
<i>though l lived here a long time...</i>

697
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:52,565
<i>l'd never really looked</i>
<i>at the desert.</i>

698
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:01,846
<i>Before, when l saw a mountain</i>
<i>l wanted to know what lay behind.</i>

699
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,548
<i>But not anymore.</i>

700
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:07,748
<i>Fate made me an orphan.</i>

701
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,018
<i>My parents died young.</i>

702
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,784
<i>My brother raised me.</i>

703
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:18,693
<i>Being an orphan,</i>
<i>l always had to fend for myself.</i>

704
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:23,600
<i>l learned the best way</i>
<i>to avoid rejection...</i>

705
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:25,966
<i>is to reject others first.</i>

706
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:31,205
<i>This is why</i>
<i>l've never returned home.</i>

707
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,109
<i>lt wasn't bad there.</i>

708
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,951
<i>But what have l to go back for?</i>

709
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:42,548
<i>l was born under the influence</i>
<i>of a total eclipse.</i>

710
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:47,318
<i>Love was destined to be out of reach.</i>

711
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:22,260
<i>That night,</i>
<i>l suddenly needed a drink.</i>

712
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,494
<i>l finished the bottle of magic wine.</i>

713
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:30,469
<i>l carried on with business as usual.</i>

714
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,510
By the Iooks of you,
I'd say you're about forty.

715
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:41,943
In those forty years...

716
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:46,182
there must be peopIe you wish
you had never Iaid eyes on.

717
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:49,918
Maybe they hurt you.

718
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:53,354
Maybe you even considered
kiIIing them.

719
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:57,790
But you didn't have the ne<i>rv</i>e.

720
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,599
ActuaIIy kiIIing is no big deaI.

721
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:07,100
No sweat at aII.

722
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:11,510
Now I have a friend
who knows some martiaI arts.

723
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,677
He's a IittIe down
on his Iuck these days.

724
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:19,718
For a smaII fee, he'II be happy
to rid you of that person.

725
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:25,424
Think about it.

726
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,019
But be quick.

727
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,224
If you wait...

728
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:37,199
<i>When work was not busy, l'd look in</i>
<i>the direction of White Camel Mountain.</i>

729
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:42,769
<i>l remembered a woman</i>
<i>was waiting for me there.</i>

730
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:52,642
<i>That magic wine was just</i>
<i>a joke she played on me.</i>

731
01:24:55,023 --> 01:25:00,552
<i>The more you try to forget,</i>
<i>the better you'll remember.</i>

732
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,695
<i>People say...</i>

733
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:08,958
<i>when you can't have what you want,</i>
<i>the best you can do...</i>

734
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:12,163
<i>is not to forget.</i>

735
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:22,745
<i>l don't know why l have</i>
<i>these recurring dreams.</i>

736
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,550
<i>l left the desert</i>
<i>soon afterwards.</i>

737
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,442
<i>The day l left, the almanac</i>
<i>had this to say...</i>

738
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:55,573
<i>''The Travel Star advances; Fire</i>
<i>Conquers Gold. Fortune lies West.''</i>

739
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:33,747
<i>Ouyang Feng returned to White</i>
<i>Camel Mountain the following year.</i>

740
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:37,723
<i>He became known</i>
<i>as the Lord of the West.</i>
